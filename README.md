## Roadmap

1. Data Processing:

Initiate the project by acquiring and processing the dataset, addressing missing values and ensuring data cleanliness.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilize visualizations such as scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data distribution, identify outliers, and understand relationships between variables.

3. Feature Engineering:

Apply feature engineering techniques to enhance the dataset, including handling null values by replacing them with the median and addressing categorical variables.

4. Model Building:

Select a variety of machine learning models for price prediction:
Linear Regression: Implement a foundational model achieving an accuracy of 56%.
Decision Tree: Develop a decision tree model with a 62% accuracy.
Random Forest: Construct an ensemble model with an accuracy of 61%.
XGBoost: Utilize gradient boosting, achieving the highest accuracy of 67%.

5. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate each model's performance using appropriate metrics, considering accuracy as well as other relevant measures such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Model Comparison and Selection:

Compare the performance of the models to identify the most effective algorithm for price prediction within the shopping complex.
